## VI. Preparation for Upcoming Work

1. Team to review Activity Tracking module requirements from the project documentation
2. Alex to prepare a brief presentation on the proposed Activity Tracking architecture
3. Liam to create a design-to-development handoff plan for Activity Tracking interfaces

## VII. Team Collaboration and Dynamics

The meeting demonstrated strong team collaboration, with members offering assistance on various challenges. This aligns well with the cross-functional team structure outlined in the employee profiles and project requirements.

## VIII. Administrative Tasks

Emily (kitchen restocking) and Olivia (Zoom renewal) have taken on additional administrative tasks, demonstrating the team's commitment to maintaining a smooth working environment as per their expanded responsibilities.

## IX. Comparison to Previous Meeting

Progress:
- User Authentication module advanced from 60% to 75% completion
- Activity Tracking design phase initiated, moving from planning to execution
- Development environment setup nearing completion, progressing from 85% to 90%

Challenges Addressed:
- Database schema concern raised and prioritized for review
- Responsive design issues identified and collaborative solution planned

## X. Sprint Goals Assessment

The team is making steady progress towards Sprint 1 goals, with the User Authentication and Profile Management module at approximately 75% completion. However, the responsive design and state management issues pose potential risks to timely completion. The early initiation of Activity Tracking module work aligns well with preparation for the next sprint.

## XI. Scrum Master's Role and Meeting Efficiency

Sarah Chen effectively facilitated the meeting by guiding discussions, prompting for blocker information, and summarizing key points. The meeting adhered to Daily Scrum best practices, covering necessary topics while maintaining focus and brevity.
