# HealthTrack Pro: Sprint Planning Meeting - June 10, 2024

## I. Introduction and Team Check-in

Sarah Chen, Project Manager and Scrum Master, opened the meeting by welcoming the team and conducting a brief check-in. All team members expressed their readiness and enthusiasm for the project:

- Alex Rodriguez (Senior Full-Stack Developer)
- Emily Watson (Frontend Developer)
- Michael Kim (Backend Developer)
- Olivia Martinez (QA Engineer / DevOps Specialist)
- Liam Foster (UI/UX Designer)

## II. Project Overview and Context

Sarah Chen provided an overview of the HealthTrack Pro project, emphasizing its goal to create a comprehensive web application for personal health management. The application will allow users to track daily activities, nutrition, and health metrics while providing insights and recommendations for a healthier lifestyle.

Alex Rodriguez detailed the technology stack:

1. Frontend: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
2. Backend: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL
3. DevOps: Docker, AWS, Jenkins
4. Design: Figma, Adobe Creative Suite

The team acknowledged that this sprint's goal aligns with the project requirements by focusing on the foundational User Authentication and Profile Management features, which are critical for personalizing user experiences and ensuring data security.

## III. MVP Feature Prioritization

The team discussed and prioritized the following features for the MVP:

1. User Authentication and Profile Management
2. Activity Tracking (steps, exercise, sleep)
3. Health Metrics Dashboard (weight, heart rate, blood pressure)
4. Goal Setting and Progress Tracking
5. Nutrition Logging and Analysis (if time permits)

The team agreed to postpone the Recommendation Engine, Social Features, and third-party integrations for future sprints, aligning with the project's phased approach outlined in the requirements document.

## IV. Sprint Goal Setting

The team established the sprint goal: "Implement basic User Authentication and Profile Management, including user registration, login functionality, and a simple profile page."

This goal contributes to the project's Phase 1 (MVP) requirements, setting the foundation for user data management and personalized experiences.

## V. Task Breakdown and Estimation

The team broke down the sprint goal into tasks and estimated them using story points:

### User Registration (17 points)
1. Design and implement registration form UI (3 points)
2. Create API endpoint for user registration (5 points)
3. Implement form validation on frontend and backend (included in above)
4. Set up secure password hashing (2 points)
5. Implement email verification process (5 points)
6. Store user data in the database (2 points)

### Login Functionality (10 points)
1. Design and implement login form UI (2 points)
2. Create API endpoint for user authentication (5 points)
3. Implement JWT for session management (included in above)
4. Handle login errors and edge cases (3 points)

### Profile Page (13 points)
1. Design layout and components of the profile page (3 points)
2. Implement profile page UI (5 points)
3. Create API endpoint to fetch user profile data (2.5 points)
4. Implement basic profile update functionality (2.5 points)

Total sprint workload: 40 story points

The team acknowledged that this is their first sprint and agreed to monitor their velocity closely to adjust future sprint planning if needed.

## VI. Task Assignment

- Emily Watson: Lead on frontend tasks (registration, login, and profile page UI implementation)
- Alex Rodriguez: Oversee overall architecture, support both frontend and backend tasks
- Michael Kim: Focus on backend tasks (API endpoints and database work)
- Olivia Martinez: Set up testing infrastructure and work on test cases for all features
- Liam Foster: Provide necessary designs for all components

## VII. Technical Considerations

1. Development Environment: Docker for containerization
2. Initial Architecture: Monolithic approach (with potential for future microservices)
3. Git Workflow: Feature branches and pull requests with branch protection rules
4. Code Quality: ESLint and Prettier for both frontend and backend
5. CI/CD Pipeline: Jenkins for automated testing on pull requests
6. Database Migration: Knex.js for managing schema changes
7. Error Handling and Logging: Winston library and global error handling middleware in Express
8. Code Review Process: At least one approval required before merging
9. Deployment Strategy: Continuous deployment to a staging environment, manual promotion to production

## VIII. Team Norms and Communication Protocols

1. Daily Stand-ups: 9:30 AM via Zoom
2. Sprint Duration: Two weeks
3. Communication Tools: Slack for day-to-day communication, Zoom for video calls
4. Slack Channels: #general, #frontend, #backend, #design, and #testing
5. Project Management Tool: Jira for sprint backlog and task tracking

## IX. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. Risk: Ensuring secure password hashing and storage
   Mitigation: Use bcrypt for password hashing and follow OWASP guidelines for secure storage

2. Risk: Implementing email verification
   Mitigation: Use a reliable email service provider and implement proper error handling

3. Risk: Creating a smooth, intuitive user experience for the authentication flow
   Mitigation: Conduct user testing and iterate based on feedback

4. Risk: Designing an extendable profile page
   Mitigation: Use modular design principles and plan for future feature additions

## X. Definition of Done

The team agreed on the following criteria for considering a task complete:

1. Code implemented and tested locally
2. Unit tests written and passing
3. Code reviewed and approved by at least one team member
4. Integration tests passing
5. Documentation updated (if applicable)
6. Deployed successfully to the staging environment
7. Acceptance criteria met and verified by the product owner

## XI. Sprint Progress Tracking

The team will use the following methods to track sprint progress:

1. Jira Sprint Board: Updated daily to reflect task status
2. Burndown Chart: Monitored to ensure steady progress
3. Daily Stand-ups: Brief progress updates and identification of blockers

## XII. Additional Tasks and Announcements

1. Alex Rodriguez: Contact electrician about flickering lights in conference room B (Deadline: June 13th)
2. Sarah Chen: Schedule office plants maintenance service (Deadline: June 19th)
3. Michael Kim: Renew Adobe Creative Cloud team license (Deadline: June 28th)
4. Olivia Martinez: Restock office first aid kits (Deadline: June 13th)
5. Emily Watson: Arrange for server room AC maintenance (Deadline: June 23rd)

## XIII. Meeting Wrap-up

Sarah Chen recapped the key decisions and assignments. The next sprint planning meeting is scheduled for June 24th, 2024. Team members expressed their excitement and commitment to the HealthTrack Pro project.

All team members are tasked with reviewing the project requirements document to ensure alignment with overall project goals before the sprint begins.
