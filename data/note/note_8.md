  - Aggregate data for long-term storage to manage volume without losing insights
- Action Item: Develop data aggregation idea further and discuss with the team

### E. Testing Approach (Olivia Martinez)
- In Progress: Drafting test scenarios for various activity inputs
- Planning: 
  1. Simulate data from different devices
  2. Ensure system can handle diverse data formats
  3. Develop stress tests for high volumes of simultaneous data inputs

### F. Design Progress (Liam Foster)
- Completed: Initial wireframes for activity input interfaces and data visualizations
- In Progress: Creating detailed mockups

  1. Making manual data entry process intuitive
  2. Providing clear and insightful data visualizations

Critical Path Item: The Activity Tracking module is a core MVP feature. Timely completion of the architecture and third-party integration strategy is crucial for maintaining the project timeline.

## IV. Technical Challenges and Security Concerns

### A. Data Privacy and Security Compliance (Alex Rodriguez)
- Identified need to strengthen current security measures
- Proposed:
  1. Implement end-to-end encryption for all health-related data
  2. Introduce more granular user permissions
- Action Item: Document proposed security enhancements for team review

### B. Additional Security Measures (Michael Kim)
- Proposed: Implement robust audit logging for all data access and modifications
