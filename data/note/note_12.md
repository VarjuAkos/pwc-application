V. User Story Identification, Prioritization, and Estimation
The team identified, prioritized, and estimated the following user stories:

A. User Story 1: Account Creation and Profile Setup (Highest Priority)
   "As a new user, I want to be able to create an account and set up my profile so that I can start tracking my health data."
   - Basic information: name, age, gender, height, current weight
   - Option to set initial health goals (e.g., target weight, daily step count)
   Estimation: 
   1. Basic registration and profile setup: 5 points
   2. Advanced security measures: 8 points (deferred to next sprint)

B. User Story 2: Manual Activity Input (High Priority)
   "As a user, I want to be able to manually input my daily activities, such as steps taken, exercises performed, and hours slept, so that I can track my progress over time."
   - Input forms for various activity types
   - Quick-add feature for common activities
   - Data validation to prevent unrealistic values
   Estimation: 8 points

C. User Story 3: Health Metrics Dashboard (Medium Priority)
   "As a user, I want to view a dashboard of my health metrics, including recent activities, current weight, and progress towards my goals, so that I can get a quick overview of my health status."
   - Display of key health metrics
   - Visualization of recent activities and progress
   - Use of charts and graphs for data representation
   Estimation: 13 points (partial implementation planned for this sprint)
