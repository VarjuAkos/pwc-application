2. Prioritize initial features for MVP
3. Break features into specific tasks and estimate complexity
4. Decide on sprint duration
5. Define "Definition of Done"
6. Address technical considerations
7. Identify potential risks
8. Set sprint goals

## III. HealthTrack Pro Project Overview

Sarah Chen provided a brief overview of HealthTrack Pro, emphasizing its purpose as a comprehensive web application for personal health management. Key points discussed:

- The application will allow users to track daily activities, nutrition, and health metrics.
- It will provide insights and recommendations for a healthier lifestyle.
- Liam Foster emphasized the importance of creating an intuitive dashboard for presenting health information.
- Emily Watson stressed the need for a responsive and functional interface across different devices.

## IV. MVP Feature Prioritization

The team agreed on four main components for Phase 1 (MVP):

1. User Authentication and Profile Management
2. Activity Tracking
3. Nutrition Logging
4. Basic Health Metrics Dashboard

These features align with the initial project requirements and provide a solid foundation for the application.

## V. Sprint Duration Decision

After discussion, the team unanimously agreed on two-week sprints. Reasons for this decision:

- Allows significant progress without losing focus
- Provides adequate time for thorough testing (important for Olivia's QA role)
- Allows for estimation adjustments, particularly useful in the project's early stages

## VI. Definition of Done Establishment

The team collaboratively defined the following criteria for the Definition of Done:

1. All acceptance criteria met
2. Code reviewed and approved
3. Unit tests written and passing
4. Functional testing completed
5. No critical bugs present
6. Successfully integrated with main development branch
7. UI consistent with design system
8. Accessibility checks passed

This comprehensive Definition of Done ensures high-quality deliverables and aligns with the team's expertise and project requirements.

1. Data privacy and security compliance (e.g., HIPAA)
2. Database schema design for scalability
3. Responsive design and cross-device performance
4. Comprehensive testing strategy
5. Accessibility considerations
6. Challenges with third-party integrations (especially for activity tracking and nutrition data)
7. Timeline concerns for implementing features with polished UI
8. Data consistency and synchronization issues
9. Handling edge cases in user input
