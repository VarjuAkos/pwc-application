II. Project Overview

III. Project Requirements Review

IV. Sprint Goal Setting

The team agreed on the following sprint goal:
"Develop a functional prototype of HealthTrack Pro that allows users to sign up, log basic health data, view a simple dashboard, and receive elementary insights."

This sprint goal aligns with the project's overall timeline, targeting MVP completion within 2-3 months. Achieving this goal will provide a solid foundation for subsequent sprints and keep the project on track for timely delivery.

V. Task Breakdown, Estimation, and Prioritization

The team broke down tasks, estimated effort using story points, and prioritized them for the MVP:

A. User Authentication and Basic Profiles (39 story points) - High Priority
   [No changes to subtasks]

B. Activity and Nutrition Tracking (42 story points) - High Priority
   [No changes to subtasks]

C. Basic Dashboard and Data Visualization (39 story points) - Medium Priority
   [No changes to subtasks]

D. Initial Insights and Recommendations (34 story points) - Low Priority
   [No changes to subtasks]

Total story points: 150
Agreed sprint capacity: 100-120 story points for the two-week sprint

Prioritization Strategy:
- High priority items (A and B) are essential for the MVP and should be completed first.
- Medium priority items (C) should be addressed if time permits after high priority items.
- Low priority items (D) are considered nice-to-have for this sprint and will be tackled only if all other items are completed ahead of schedule.

Workload Distribution:
| Team Member | Story Points | Main Focus Areas                    |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Alex        | 26           | Backend Auth, API Endpoints          |
| Emily       | 47           | Frontend Components                  |
| Michael     | 29           | Data Models, Aggregation Queries     |
| Liam        | 29           | UI Design                            |
| Olivia      | 23           | QA and Testing                       |

Note: Emily has a higher workload and may need support from other team members if she falls behind.

VI. Technical Considerations

Key Technical Decisions:
1. Authentication: JWT-based authentication with optional two-factor authentication for enhanced security.
2. Data Storage: PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM for efficient data management and future scalability.
3. Frontend Framework: React.js with TypeScript for robust, type-safe development.
4. UI Components: Material-UI library for consistent design and faster development.
5. API Design: RESTful API with clear endpoints and proper error handling.
6. DevOps: Docker for containerization, GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline.

Development Environment and Coding Standards:
- Docker-based local development environment for consistency across the team.
- Airbnb style guide for JavaScript and React to ensure code consistency.
- Emphasis on clean code, comprehensive testing (80% code coverage target), and security best practices.

IX. Potential Risks and Challenges

1. Timeline Pressure: The ambitious sprint goal may put pressure on the team, potentially compromising code quality.
   Mitigation: Daily stand-ups to identify blockers early, and team members should communicate proactively if they're falling behind.

2. Technical Debt: Rapid development might lead to accumulating technical debt.
   Mitigation: Adhere strictly to coding standards and conduct thorough code reviews. Allocate time in future sprints for refactoring if necessary.

3. Integration Challenges: As this is the first sprint, integrating different components might be challenging.
   Mitigation: Plan for integration testing early in the sprint and allocate time for resolving potential issues.

4. Scope Creep: There's a risk of adding too many features to the MVP.
   Mitigation: Strictly adhere to the prioritized task list and defer any non-essential features to future sprints.

X. Open Questions and Unresolved Issues

1. Data Privacy Compliance: Need to confirm if any specific data protection regulations apply to health data storage and processing.
2. Performance Benchmarks: Specific performance targets for the dashboard and data processing need to be defined.
3. User Onboarding: The team needs to discuss and plan the user onboarding process in a future meeting.

XI. Meeting Conclusion
