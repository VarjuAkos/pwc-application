- [High Priority] Research security scanning tools for HIPAA compliance

### E. Liam Foster (UI/UX Designer)

#### Yesterday's Progress:
- Created user flows and wireframes for Authentication and Profile Management interfaces
- Completed initial designs for login, registration, and password recovery flows

#### Today's Focus:
- Working on user profile editing interface design
- Starting concept development for Activity Tracking module interface

#### Concerns:
- Designing interfaces for displaying sensitive health information in a HIPAA-compliant manner

#### Additional Tasks:
- Compiled quotes from three carpet cleaning services

#### Action Items:
- [High Priority] Share wireframes with Emily for profile page implementation
- [Medium Priority] Schedule a meeting to discuss HIPAA-compliant design considerations
- [Low Priority] Share carpet cleaning service quotes with the team

## IV. Blockers and Challenges Discussion

1. HIPAA Compliance:
   - Team-wide concern about ensuring proper implementation of HIPAA requirements
   - Alex to lead research and propose solutions for secure authentication and data handling

2. Timeline Concerns:
   - Emily raised concerns about the feasibility of implementing all planned features with a polished UI within the sprint
   - Sarah acknowledged the concern and suggested closely monitoring progress and potentially adjusting sprint goals

3. Security Implementation:
   - Michael emphasized the potential underestimation of time required for implementing proper security measures for HIPAA compliance
   - Alex tasked with creating a detailed timeline for HIPAA compliance implementation

## V. Risks and Mitigation

1. Risk: Underestimation of time for HIPAA compliance implementation
   Mitigation: Alex to create a detailed timeline for HIPAA compliance tasks, team to reassess sprint goals based on this timeline

2. Risk: Scope creep due to complex UI requirements
   Mitigation: Emily and Liam to prioritize essential UI elements, team to consider moving some advanced UI features to future sprints

3. Risk: Delays in frontend-backend integration
   Mitigation: Schedule regular sync-ups between Emily and Michael to ensure alignment on API requirements and implementation

## VI. Team Collaboration Highlights

- Emily and Liam planning to collaborate closely on the profile page design, ensuring a smooth transition from design to implementation
- Alex, Michael, and Olivia to have a focused meeting on HIPAA compliance measures across authentication, data storage, and DevOps practices

## VII. Additional Tasks and Updates

1. Time Tracking Software:
   - Current subscription expires at the end of the month
   - Vendor offering 15% discount for annual plan
   - Emily to prepare pros and cons list for annual vs. monthly subscription

2. Office Maintenance:
   - Router firmware update scheduled by Michael
